	<h2> First created in Aug 2013, updated in Sep 2013 and made an alpha version in Dec 2013. That is a very bad pace of development. There are people who've perfected html and css in the time it took me to make this site. While the time it took is something to be ashamed of, i'm pretty happy to have finally finished it. Almost resembles what i had in mind the first time i started sketching out the design and laying out the functionality of this site. And while i deny it, shifting to windows was more than responsible for this. Monkeys can use the github windows GUI and i guess it makes sense that i learnt how to use it in about an hour. </h2>
	<h2> Bottom line, the site is finally up and running. Let's see how long i can keep this streak going :) </h2>
