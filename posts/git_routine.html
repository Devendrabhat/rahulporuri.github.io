				Git routine.<br><br>
			</font>
			<font size='4'>
				I did not know the git routine on linux so i chose the dark side. <a href="https://windows.github.com">GitHub for Windows</a> was of enormous help to get me started with GitHub and i was happily clicking away to commit and push for over a month. But the day had finally come for me to switch back to linux and learn how the git (command line) routine.<br><br>

				One starts off with generating an (unique) SSH key on your computer and adding this to your GitHub profile. Refer to this <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">github help article</a> to know how to generate said SSH keys and adding them.<br><br>

				<em>NOTE: if the directory ~/.ssh does not exist, then create one. If you haven't used ssh on your system so far, there will not exist one.</em><br><br>

				Post authentication, sync your GitHub online repositories with your local ones, if you have such. One can use either 
				<em>$git pull https://github.com/reposity.git</em> or <br><em>$git clone https://github.com/reposity.git</em> to do so.

				The advantage of 
				<em>$git clone https://github.com/foobar.git</em>  over <br><em>$git pull https://github.com/foobar.git</em>
				is that a remote origin will by default be added to which commits will be pushed. Simply put, the routine becomes 
				<em>$git pull https://github.com/foobar.git<br>
				$git remote add foobar https://github.com/foobar.git<br>$git push foobar</em>
				or just
				<em>$git clone https://github.com/foobar.git<br>$git push origin</em>

				<em>$git add .</em>  or<br><em>$git add folder/*</em> can be used to check the current/specific directory for changes and staging them for commit.
				<em>$git commit -m 'commit message'</em> will commit the staged changes. One can also do 
				<em>$git commit -a -m 'commit message'</em> to directly add changes, staging them and committing them at once.
				And finally,<em>$git push origin/foobar</em> will push the commits to the master branch (unless otherwise specified).
				<em>$git status</em> is a convenience command to check, at different points in time, what the changes are, what files are being staged for a commit or waiting to be pushed.
