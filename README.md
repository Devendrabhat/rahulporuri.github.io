=====================
The contents of this repository are my personal webpage files. I thought it better to host my site on github than on some paid service or on a college machine. And it looks cool having a username.github.io address :D

features implemented so far - 
* style sheets corresponding to the menu bar being on the left, right, top and bottom of the web page.
* style sheet giving a two column/checkered layout to the webpage.
* date and time of update.
* font and color combinations.
* converted npx to n% on main stylesheet, to be done on the rest!
* making a list of good fonts, a never-ending process!
* added research pages corresponding to ATSOA, POS. Need to add intern research pages!
* border around the content and links.  I'm satisfied with the overall design now.
* background image - subtlebackground, grey.
* the first of the css exercises on [codeschool](http://www.codeschool.com/) are done, the rest are behind a paywall. talks about html attributes aside, article. Also checkout the new html attributes in html5!
* currently using sawasdee on the webpage, set starry background image and white for text/image. more changes (to links!)?
* the star wars themed text scroller implemented. [reference](http://www.sitepoint.com/css3-starwars-scrolling-text/)
* removed redundant left/right & top/bottom css file copies and added them as comments at the end of the css files.

to be implemented - 
* time stamp on blog posts.
* figure out how to determine the size of the screen using js or using css functions.
* set the height of the encompass id depending on the length of text inside!
* how to fill boxes with text to the end using apostaphies instead of full words being skipped to the next sentence - using css regions and css exclusions refer to the tutorial [here](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/regions/adobe/)
* use a terminal themed site which can access files using ls/more/less/cd etc similar to the one found [here](http://try.github.com/)
* a new div for blocks of code - a different font, probably times new roman and a different background color, probably grey.
* rounded edges for every div element.

some interesting fonts to use are - 
* verdana is too fat. arial is too thick
* times new roman is just bleh and not cambria either
* courier new is typical!
* Palatino linotype is ohkay
* segoe print/script are interesting and gabriola is a fancy font
* consolas is terminal font and so is corbel! :D...
* candara is awesome and trebuchet just close to perfection.
* Source Sans Pro and Old Standard TT
* Rockwell, Roboto, Raleway, PT Sans, Open Sans, Gill Sans
* Exo, Futura, Droid Sans, Coustard, Cabin, Arvo, Bitter
* dejavu, droid, freemono, freesans, sawasdee - fonts that work.

I should learn how to install and use new fonts and check out some of the fonts available [here](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/popular), [here](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2011/08/the-most-popular-fonts-used-by-designers/) and [here](http://platowebdesign.com/articles/fonts/). 

and some interesting colors to choose are - 
* #FFFFFA, #00D9FF, #FF9933, #FFCC66
* #99CCFF, #0099CC, #29A3A3
* #CCFFFF, #669999
