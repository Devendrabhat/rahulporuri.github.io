=====================
The contents of this repository are my personal webpage files. I thought it better to host my site on github than on some paid service or on a college machine. And it looks cool having a username.github.io address :D

features implemented so far - 
* style sheets corresponding to the menu bar being on the left, right, top and bottom of the web page.
* style sheet giving a two column/checkered layout to the webpage.

to be implemented - 
* use of multiple fonts (headings and text) and colors (background, on menus). 
* make list of good fonts - not just for website but for general typesetting!
* modifying how links in the menu bar look.
* edges/boxes around the content and menu. 
* date and time of update.
* time stamp on blog posts.
* add research pages corresponding to schools/workshops and projects - with data/codes/presentations/reports.
