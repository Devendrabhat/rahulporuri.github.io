=====================
The contents of this repository are my personal webpage files. I thought it better to host my site on github than on some paid service or on a college machine. And it looks cool having a name.github.io address :D

I shall try experimenting with the layout of my site regularly - as a way to stay fresh and as a way to learn html and css better, starting with the two css style sheets that are left-handed and right-handed.

Further, i intend to move my blog here from blogger and have a simple display for my future blog posts.
