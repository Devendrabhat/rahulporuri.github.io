=====================
The contents of this repository are my personal webpage files. I thought it better to host my site on github than on some paid service or on a college machine. And it looks cool having a username.github.io address :D

features implemented so far - 
* style sheets corresponding to the menu bar being on the left, right, top and bottom of the web page.
* style sheet giving a two column/checkered layout to the webpage.
* date and time of update.
* font and color combinations.
* converted npx to n% on main stylesheet, to be done on the rest!
* making a list of good fonts, a never-ending process!
* added research pages corresponding to ATSOA, POS. Need to add intern research pages!
* border around the content and links.  I'm satisfied with the overall design now.

to be implemented - 
* use of multiple fonts (headings and text) and colors (background, on menus). 
* modifying how links in the menu bar look.
* time stamp on blog posts.

some interesting fonts to use are - 
* verdana is too fat. 
* not arial. is too thick
* times new roman is just bleh
* not cambria " "
* courier new is standard again!
* Palatino linotype can be tried
* segoe print/script are interesting
* gabriola is some fancy font
* consolas is terminal font! :D...
* so is corbel
* candara is awesome! 
* trebuchet just close to perfection.
