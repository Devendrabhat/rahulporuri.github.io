          <p> I recently started as a fulltime Software Developer at 
          <a href="https://www.enthought.com">Enthougt Inc.</a> after 
          working as an intern for two months. I'm currently living 
          and working from Pune, India. I graduated with a Dual Degree 
          (B.S. & M.S.) in Physics from IIT Madras, Chennai, India. 
          After an unsuccessfull attempt at getting an admission to a grad 
          school to pursue a Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics, I
          decided to take a shot at being a dev and so far, so good!</p>
          <p> Over the last two months, I've worked on a couple of long 
          standing side projects of mine, one related to the 
          <a href="https://rahulporuri.github.io/uniLocs/">locations</a> 
          of institutes and labs that pursue astronomical research around
          the world and another to create a 
          <a href="https://rahulporuri.github.io/authorAffiliations">network graph</a>
           of publications.</p>
          <p> I also worked on numerous astronomy and physics related 
          projects over the last three years of college, projects that 
          helped me appreciate the Python programming language and 
          programming in general, which you can find on 
          <a href="https://github.com/rahulporuri/">my Github profile.</a>
          You can also find them in the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page.</p>
          <p>I also like to occassionally ramble, which you can 
          read about on <a href="#">my blog</a>.
          My twitter handle is <code>@rahulporuri</code> and you can email
          me at <code><a href="mailto:rahul.poruri@gmail.com">rahul.poruri@gmail.com</a></code></p>
          <p><em>NOTE:</em> If you feel deja-vu as you are going through 
          this website, as though you've seen this layout before, 
          it's because I lifted the layout straight out of 
          <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/examples/justified-nav/">this website</a></p>
