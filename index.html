				I'm Rahul, currently pursuing a BS & MS degree in Physics with a minor in Chemistry at IIT Madras. I'm passionate about astronomy & astrophysics, applied computation and electronics in the context of astronomy. I have had some prior experience in the field, ranging from participation in winter schools and workshops to working on summer projects as an intern. For a broad overview of my research experience, you can visit the <a href='research.html'>Research</a> page.

			<br>
				I try to maintain active github and blogger accounts, the former I use to store my course work and side projects and the latter I use as a daily journal of interesting things that I come across. One of my side projects includes making fun physics simulations on an ipython notebook using ipywidgets. You can check them out on the <a href='blog.html'>Blog</a> page. I also make projects involving astronomical data, data which upon visualization can help understand the underlying concept. They are available <a href='github.com/rahulporuri/astro_data_projects/'>here.</a>

				Any comments you have regarding my work or my projects are appreciated and always welcome.
