				I am Rahul, currently pursuing a BS & MS degree in Physics with a minor in Chemistry at IIT Madras. I'm passionate about astronomy & astrophysics, applied computation and electronics in the context of astronomy. I have had some prior experience in the field, ranging from participation in winter schools and workshops to working on summer projects as an intern. For a broad overview of my research experience, you can visit the <a href='research.html'>Research</a> page.

			<br>
				I am currently working with <a href="http://www.physics.iitm.ac.in/~sriram/">Dr. L. Sriramkumar</a> on the generation and evolution of tensor perturbations during various inflationary scanarios and in bouncing universes. I developed a python code to numerically evaluate the evolution of tensor perturbations during inflation and to estimate the tensor power spectrum at super-Hubble scales. You can find the relevant code and results in <a href=''>this</a> Github repository. A project report pertaining to this work can be found <a href=>here</a>. I am also developing a code to numerically evaluate the tensor bi-spectrum.

			<br>
			<br>
				I try to maintain an active github account and a blog, the former of which I use for course work and side projects. One of my side projects includes making fun physics simulations on an ipython notebook using ipywidgets. You can check them out on the <a href='blog.html'>Blog</a> page. I also make academic learning projects involving astronomical data, available <a href='github.com/rahulporuri/astro_data_projects/'>here.</a>
