				Hey! I am Rahul, a final year student pursuing a B.S. & M.S. degree in Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India. As part of my academic curriculum and outside of it, I have pursued a variety of projects related to astronomy and astrophysics. I am interested in extra-galactic astronomy, observational cosmology, applied computation and electronics. My experiences so far motivate to stay in the field. After graduation, I would like to pursue a graduate degree and down the road, I see myself becoming a full time researcher.
			<br>
			<br>
				I am currently working with <a href="http://www.physics.iitm.ac.in/~sriram">Dr. L. Sriramkumar</a> towards my Master's thesis. I am developing a code to numerically evaluate the tensor bi-spectrum during matter bounce. You can refer to <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06475">this</a> paper for a better understanding of the theory behind what I am currently working on. Earlier, as part of a smaller project, I developed a code to numerically evaluate the power spectrum of tensor perturbations in the super-Hubble limit during two models of inflation, namely power law inflation and inflation driven by a small field potential model. You can find the relevant code and results <a href="http://www.github.com/rahulporuri/project_work">here</a>. You can find a detailed outline of my research exposure <a href="research.html">here</a>.
			<br>
			<br>
				In my free time, I like writing. I try maintaining an active <a href="http://www.rahulporuri.blogspot.in">blog</a>. And since I got good at programming a couple of years back, I've been working on course projects involving programming. You can find most of my work in my <a href="http://www.github.com/rahulporuri/">Github</a> repositories.
<!--				Any comments you have regarding my work or my projects are appreciated and always welcome.
