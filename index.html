           <p> I recently started as a fulltime Software Developer at
           <a href="https://www.enthought.com">Enthougt Inc.</a> after
           working as an intern for two months. I'm currently living
           and working from Pune, India. I graduated with a Dual Degree
           (B.S. & M.S.) in Physics from IIT Madras, Chennai, India.
           After an unsuccessfull attempt at getting an admission to a grad
           school to pursue a Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics, I
           decided to take a shot at being a dev and so far, so good!</p>
           <p> Over the last two months, I've worked on a couple of long
           standing side projects of mine, one related to the
           <a href="https://rahulporuri.github.io/uniLocs/">locations</a>
           of institutes and labs that pursue astronomical research around
           the world and another to create a
           <a href="https://rahulporuri.github.io/authorAffiliations">network graph</a>
            of publications.</p>
           <p> I also worked on numerous astronomy and physics related
           projects over the last three years of college, projects that
           helped me appreciate the Python programming language and
           programming in general, which you can find on
           <a href="https://github.com/rahulporuri/">my Github profile.</a>
           You can also find them in the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page.</p>
           <p>I also like to occassionally ramble, which you can
           read about on <a href="#">my blog</a>.
           My twitter handle is <code>@rahulporuri</code> and you can email
           me at <code><a href="mailto:rahul.poruri@gmail.com">rahul.poruri@gmail.com</a></code></p>

           this website, as though you've seen this layout before,
           it's because I lifted the layout straight out of
