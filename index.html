					I'm Rahul, currently pursuing my final-year of a BS & MS degree in Physics with a minor in Chemistry at IIT Madras. I'm studying Radiative Processes in Astrophysics with Prof. L. Sriramkumar for my final year project. I'm passionate about astronomy & astrophysics, and have some experience.<br><br>

					My objective is for a graduate school admission in a doctoral programme in the field of Astronomy & Astrophysics, followed by a career in research and teaching.<br><br>

					My interests lie in astronomy, astrophysics and instrumentation, specifically in the fields of real-time event detection & classification, photometric redshift estimation and astronomical surveys. I am also interested in Extra-Galactic astronomy, specifically the study of quasars and their use in the understanding galactic halos, intervening absorbers and the high redshift (z>6) universe.<br><br>

					In the past, I've worked on studying the colors of quasars using SDSS data with Prof. Anand Narayanan at IIST, Trivandrum. I've also worked on constructing a Tully-Fisher relationship using the H alpha emission line from integral field spectra of galaxies observed by the SAMI galaxy survey. This work was done under the guidance of Prof. Jeremy Mould at Center for Astrophysics & Supercomputing, Swinburne Institute of Technology, Melbourne.
