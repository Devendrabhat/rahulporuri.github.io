	<em>Personal Interests and Extra-Curricular Work: </em><br>
	</h2>

	<p> I am personally interested in Astronomy and am currently part of the team that heads the amateur astronomy club at IIT Madras - <a href="https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/www.astro.iitm.ac.in/Home">Astro IITM</a> We conduct regular theory sessions on different aspects of astronomy, popular astronomy and science in general. And given the chance (it being chennai) we setup our telescopes for observation. We are currently working on different projects related to radio astronomy and astro-photography. We are currently part of the CFI clubs team as well <br> <br> Also, as part of IIT Madras's technical festival <a href="https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/www.shaastra.iitm.ac.in"> Shaastra </a> with the help of the astronomy club, i have conducted a couple of workshops on Astronomy and on How to Build an Alt-Az telescope, on Astrophotography and Image Processing. And we occasionally conduct Outreach sessions for school children in and around chennai to raise their awareness and get them interested towards astronomy and science in general <br><br> Also, i've been part of the <a href="https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/eml.iitm.ac.in">EML team</a> at IIT Madras which works on bringing eminent personalities from varied fields to IIT Madras for lectures, to inspire and give the campusites a perspective on the different fields. you can read up more on the different people we've had as part of this lecture series on the website.</p>
