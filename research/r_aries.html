			A major part of the ARIES training school is data analysis and as part of a team of 5, I was studying the polarization of light from a star forming region Stock 8 in the constellation Auriga. The data was collected using the ARIES Imaging Polarimeter instrument (AImPol) at the ARIES 1.04m telescope.
		<br>
		<br>
			We measured the stokes parameters of multiple stars and estimated the overall polarization of light. We estimated the density of dust in the star forming region using the polarization and using standard stars. We also differentiated between field stars and foreground stars by studying the amount of polarization.
