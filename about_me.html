<div id="content"><font size = "2" face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><h2>Hi, I'm Poruri Sai Rahul, an undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
I'm currently pursuing a BS & MS degree in Physics.
My interests lie in astronomy, astrophysics and instrumentation.</h2>
<h2>I did my schooling in Ongole, Andhra Pradesh and my +2 at Narayana Junior College, Hyderabad. After being coached/trained to write IIT-JEE for 2 years, I finally made through with a rank of 2944. I joined IIT Madras to pursue a degree in BS & MS in Physics. I am in the first batch of my course so it was interesting trying to explain what i was doing at IIT Madras to the seniors in my hostel during the first semester, if i joined IIT through JEE or some other admission process and if i was human in the first place.</h2>
<h2>After trying almost every extra-curricular activity there is on campus for the first couple of years, i figured it was about time i stopped straying off the path and worked towards my degree in physics. It was just about this time i figured that i was intereted in astronomy and that i wanted to pursue higher studies in astronomy/astrophysics.</h2>
<h2>some of the extra-cucciculars are - Shaastra Co-Ordinator 2010 and 2011 for Astronomy Workshops - during which, as part of a team of 4, workshops were organised to build a 4 inch newtonian telescope and to pursue Astro-Photography. I was an EML volunteer in 2009 and an EML Co-Ordinator in 2010, handling event organisation. some of the eminent speakers who were EML speakers during 2010-2011 were - . Following year, as part of a team of 3, we participated and won the intra-college simchamp competition - where in we were asked to simulate the dynamics of an anot colony and emulate the ant behavior. several factors like blah bluh and bleh were taken into consideration while pursuing the simulation.</h2>
<h2>Having settled on astronomy, i started attending workshops and schools on astronomy. I pursued a summer internship in astronomy. I am currently pursuing a summer internship under the guidance of prof. Jeremy Mould, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia.</h2>
