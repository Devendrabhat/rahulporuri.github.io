					Hi! I'm Rahul, an undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I am pursuing a BS & MS in Physics degree at the Dept. of Physics with a minor in Chemistry. I am interested in pursuing graduate program in Astronomy & Astrophysics. Specifically, I would like to work on large scale surveys, on extra-galactic astronomy, on astronomical instrumentation and on the first stars, galaxies in the universe.<br><br>

					I've had a vibrant college life, filled with co-curricular and extra-curricular activities and the things I've done over the last 5 years have molded me and have been pivotal in steering me towards Astronomy.<br><br>

					I was schooled in my hometown of Ongole, Andhra Pradesh and after being coached for 2 years at the Narayana Junior College, Hyderabad to crack the IIT JEE, the toughest engineering entrance exam in the country, I placed 2944 in JEE `09, among the top 3% that year. I then joined the BS & MS in Physics program.<br><br>

					During the first month in college, I was part of the ambience team for the Freshers' night `09. Alas the event was cancelled due to unforseen circumstances. Later in the year, during Shaastra*, I was a volunteer for the Shaastra Car team. Over the course of a week, we built a rudimentary version of the bat-mobile i.e a car which can morph into a bike. I then went on to become a volunteer for the Extra Mural Lecture team at IIT Madras. As part of the team, I hosted and organized talks by eminent speakers such as Boman Irani. I was also a photography & equipment volunteer during Saarang, the cultural festival of IIT Madras.<br><br>

					All said and done, the amateur astronomy club 'Astro IITM' had the most impact on me. A trip to rameswaram in order to observe an annular solar eclipse in jan `10 ignited in me an interest in astronomy. I have since been involved with the club on various levels of organization.<br><br>

					During my second year of college, I coordinated a workshop on behalf of the Astronomy club during Shaastra*. As part of a team of 4, we held a workshop on how-to make telescope. Over the course of 5 days, 10 teams built newtonian reflectors. I was also a coordinator for the Extra Mural Lecture team during my second year, responsible for contacting, inviting and arranging for talks. Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Dr. Y. V. Reddy, P. Sainath are some of the people invited during `10-`11 by the EML team.<br><br>

					I coordinated a second workshop on behalf of the astronomy club during my third year of college, on Astro-photography. We took the help of Dr. Suresh Mohan, an eminent astrophotographer from Chennai. The participants were introduced to the concept of CCDs and basics of astrophotography followed by a hands-on image processing session using GIMP*.<br><br>

					Right around my fourth year of college, I found my passion in astrophysics and my interests changed from extra-curricular activies to co-curricular activities.<br><br>

					I attended the IIST Astronomy & Astrophysics School at IIST, Trivandrum during Dec `12. I then attended the ARIES Training School on Observational Astronomy at ARIES, Nainital during Mar `13. I took up a project under Dr. Anand Narayanan at IIST in the summer of `13. I then worked with Dr. Jeremy Mould at Swinburne University of Technology in the winter of `14, in the middle of my 5th year of college life. A detailed account of my work & project experience can be found on the <a href="research.html">research</a> page.<br><br>

								<dd>- In an effort to pursue amateur astrophotography and obtaining basic astronomical results using the telescope, I led an effort to acquire institute funds to buy a tracking enabled mount. Funds worth ~1,00,000 INR were granted to the club. With intentions of setting up an autonomous observatory, we are currently using the mount to give an idea of the telescope's scientific potential.</dd>

					I've written about my work experience in astronomy over the last couple of years extensively in blog posts. You can read them here.<br><br>

					If you're interested in amateur astronomy and live in & around chennai, you're welcome to join our club and attend the sessions. We have a couple of sessions every month, observation and theory like-wise. And you can join the club's facebook group to get updates on session timings and interesting astronomy trivia.<br><br>-->
