					Hi, I'm Poruri Sai Rahul, an undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I'm currently pursuing a BS & MS degree in Physics.My interests lie in astronomy, astrophysics and instrumentation.<br><br>

					I did my schooling in Ongole, Andhra Pradesh and my +2 at Narayana Junior College, Hyderabad. After being coached/trained to write IIT-JEE for 2 years, I finally made it through with a rank of 2944. I joined IIT Madras to pursue a degree in BS & MS in Physics.<br><br>

					Over the last 5 years, my interests have varied across the extra-curricular & co-curricular activity scene here at IIT Madras.<br><br>

					First year - 
					<ul>
						<li>Volunteer, Shaastra Car Team, Shaastra 2009.</li>
						<li>Volunteer, Phototography Team, Saarang 2010.</li>
						<li>Volunteer, Equipment Team, Saarang 2010.</li>
						<li>Volunteer, Extra Mural Lecture Team 2009-2010, 	IIT Madras.</li>
						<li>Volunteer, Literary Secretary Team, Jamuna Hostel, 2009-2010.</li>
					</ul><br>
			
					Second year - 
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.shaastra.org/2010/main/events/workshops/astronomy">Co-Ordinator, Astronomy Workshop, Shaatra 	2010.</a></li>
						<li>
							<dl>
								<dt>Core Team Member, Astro IITM.</dt>
								<dd>- As part of organizational commitee of Astro IITM, I've organized and conducted popular astronomy talks on a topics ranging from 'Scale of the Universe' to 'Evolution of stars' alongside regular observation sessions. We also organized the aforementioned workshop during the technical festival of IIT Madras on the basics of building a telescope. Over a 4 day period, the participants (10 teams of 5) were taught the basics of telescopes at the end of which, they had a 4 inch newtonian telescope with a dobsonian mount.</dd>

					</ul><br><br>

					Third year - 
					<ul>
						<li>Co-Ordinator, Astronomy Workshop, Shaastra 2011.</li>
						<li>
							<dl>
								<dt>Core Team Member, Astro IITM.</dt>
								<dd>- As part of organizational commitee of Astro IITM, I've conducted and spoken at outreach sessions to schools in Chennai where high school children were introduced to the basics of astronomy, telescopes and sky watching using telescopes. We also organized the aforementioned workshop during Shaastra on Astrophotography. Dr. Suresh Mohan, a prominent astrophotographer, introduced the basics of astrophotography & CCDs and post-processing of astronomical images using photoshop/gimp.</dd>

						<dl>
							<dd>- My interests matured from pursuing amateur astronomy to studying astronomy & astrophysics. Towards achieving this goal, I attended the various schools and workshops aforementioned. I also got the oppotrunity to work with Prof. Anand Narayanan at IIST, Trivandrum on the Colors of Quasars. You can read further on my <a href="research.html">research</a> page.</dd>

								<dd>- In an effort to pursue amateur astrophotography and obtaining basic astronomical results using the telescope, I led an effort to acquire institute funds to buy a tracking enabled mount. Funds worth ~1,00,000 INR were granted to the club. With intentions of setting up an autonomous observatory, we are currently using the mount to give an idea of the telescope's scientific potential.</dd>

					</ul><br>

					I've written about my work experience in astronomy over the last couple of years extensively in blog posts. You can read them here.<br><br>

					If you're interested in amateur astronomy and live in & around chennai, you're welcome to join our club and attend the sessions. We have a couple of sessions every month, observation and theory like-wise. And you can join the club's facebook group to get updates on session timings and interesting astronomy trivia.<br><br>
