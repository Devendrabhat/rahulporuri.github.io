					With <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~jmould/">Prof. Jeremy Mould</a>*, I reduced and analyzed integral field spectra of galaxies observed by the <a href="sami-survey.org">SAMI</a> instrument on the AAT.  We combed through the spectrum looking for H alpha emission lines and extracted their corresponding line widths. Instead of using the HI line widths, as is conventionally done, we used the H alpha line widths to construct the TF reln. We used the SDSS r, i & z magnitudes and galactic inclinations from NED/IPAC.<br><br>

					During our work, we discovered double-horned H alpha emission peaks. This double horned profile is usually observed in the HI galactic emission line profile, in galaxies with large rotation velocities.<br><br>

		Broadly, my interests lie in extragalactic astronomy & survey science. I am also interested in working on large scale surveys where my passion for astronomy and knack for programming fit perfectly. I have developed these interests having worked on projects and having attended workshops & schools on Astronomy over the last 3 years. To be specific,

		Constructing a Tully-Fisher (TF) relationship for SAMI galaxies :

			With Prof. Jeremy Mould(link)*, I reduced and analyzed integral field spectra of galaxies observed by the SAMI(link) instrument on the AAT.  We combed through the spectrum looking for H alpha emission lines and extracted their corresponding line widths. Instead of using the HI line widths, as is conventionally done, we used the H alpha line widths to construct the TF reln. We used the SDSS r, i & z magnitudes and galactic inclinations from NED/IPAC.

			During our work, we also discovered double-horned H alpha emission peaks. This double horned profile is usually observed in the HI galactic emission line profile. This is usually observed in galaxies with large rotation velocities.

			This work was presented at "The role of Hydrogen in the evolution galaxies" Sep `14 conference as a poster.

			The process of line finding and extraction was initially done one galaxy-at-a-time but has now been automated using a python script. Further analysis was also done in python.
