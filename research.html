					I've been part of the amateur astronomy club at IIT Madras (Astro IITM) since my first year and I've been the head of the club over the last two years (2012-2014). <br><br><br>
					Over the last couple of years, my interests have further matured from amateur astronomy to Astronomy & Astrophysics. I've been attending schools/workshops throughout the country on the subject and worked on summer projects in the field, all in pursuit of my goal, an admission for Ph.D programme in Astronomy & Astrophysics.<br><br><br>

					Summer Intern under the guidance of Prof. Jeremy Mould, CAS, Winter 2014.
					<ul>
						<li>Understanding the motivation behind the Tully-Fisher (TF) relationship and development of the fundamental plane for Spiral galaxies.</li>
						<li>Constructing a TF reln using SAMI galaxies - instead of using the HI line, we used the H\alpha emission line to extract the rotation velocity of the galaxies and construct a TF reln.</li>


						<li>Interesting twin-peak emission line feature were observed for multiple galaxies, which is a feature usually observed in the HI emission line profiles.</li>

						<li>Extracted Velocity dispersion using the PPXF routine in python to be used as a dynamical third parameter to extend the TF reln into the third dimension. Refer to C.Tonini et al (2014) for a detailed understanding of why sigma/V_c was chosen.</li>

					Participant, Pulsar Observatory for Students, ORT, Summer 2013.
					<ul>
						<li>Theory behind pulsar emission mechanisms, pulsar observation strategies and an overview of radio astronomy were taught over the course of a week.</li>
						<li>Observed the pulsar PSR B1749-28 (and it's calibrator) using the ORT telescope for 30mins (each).</li>
						<li>Analysed the data using sigproc and extracted the flux of the pulsar, period of the pulsar and the dispersion measure (therefore the distance to) the pulsar.</li>
						<li>During data analysis, I also pointed that the frequency response of the telescope was not uniform across the observable bandwidth - which was apparently a problem the authorities were working towards fixing.</li>
						<li>The presentation i prepared at the end of the school is available <a href="research/r_pos.html">here</a></li>

					Summer Intern under the guidance of Prof. Anand Narayanan, IIST, Summer 2013
					<ul>
						<li>Overview of quasars and their emission mechanisms.</li>
						<li>Studied the redshift dependence of color for quasars and how the filter design (u,g,r,i,z) of SDSS was perfect to study this dependence.</li>
						<li>Reproduced the results of Richards et al (2001) on the "Colors of Quasars" and extended them from 2565 quasars (SDSS DR3) to ~145,655 quasasr (SDSS DR9).</li>
						<li>I further modelled this redshift dependence using a composite quasar spectrum by Vandenberk et al (2001) and the SDSS filter.</li>

					Participant, ARIES Training School on Observational Astronomy, March 2013.
					<ul>
						<li>Observed the star forming region Stock 8 in the constellation Auriga using the ARIES 1.04m Sampurnanand telescope and the Imaging Polarimeter instrument (AImPol).</li>
						<li>Reduced and analyzed the data using IRAF to extract the amount of polarization dust in the nebula is contributing to.</li>
						<li>Derived the density of dust in the nebula, orientation of the magnetic field in the nebula (in comparison to the mean galactic field) and identified possible cluster members & foreground/background stars.</li>
						<li>The presentation i prepared at the end of the school is available <a href="research/r_aries.html">here</a></li>
					</ul><br><br>

					Participant, IIST Astronomy and Astrophysics School, Winter 2012.
					<ul>
						<li>The theory of Stellar formation & evolution was derived, in detail, over the course of the school.</li>
						<li>Astronomical Techniques such as Astrometry, Photometry, Spectroscopy, Polarimetry and Interferometry were introduced.</li>
						<li>Radiative processes in astrophysics were introduced.</li>
