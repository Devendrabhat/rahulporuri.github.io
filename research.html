<div id="content"><font size = "2" face="Trebuchet"><h2>I've been part of the amateur astronomy club at IIT Madras (Astro IITM) starting my first year. Over the last couple of years, my interests have matured from amateur astronomy to astronomy & astrophysics.</h2>
<h2>I attended a winter school on astronomy and astrophysics at the Indian Institute for Space science and Technology, Trivandrum. Over the course of 2 weeks, we were taught the basics of stellar evolution & astronomical instrumentation. We were also introduced to astronomical data analysis using IRAF.</h2>
<h2>The earlier winter school in Dec 2012 opened new opportunities for me and thanks to the recommendation from a professor at the winter school, I attended the ARIES training school on observational astronomy in March 2013. The primary goal of the school was to introduce students to IRAF using various projects. I was lucky enough to be able to work on the Polarizing effects of the Interstellar Medium under the guidance of post-doc Dr. ... . As part of the project work, we analyzed data from the ARIES imaging polarimeter (AImPol) and estimated the amount of polarization that dust in the star forming region Stock 8 in the constellation Auriga contributes. We also studied the alignment of magnetic fields in the star forming region to the galactic magnetic field.</h2>
<h2>I returned the following summer to IIST and worked under Prof. Anand Narayanan to reproduce results from the Richards et al (2001) paper on the Colors of Quasars. I was able to extend the results of the paper from the 2625 quasars from SDSS DR3 to ~146,000 quasars from SDSS DR9.</h2>
<h2>More recently, i was lucky enough to get a chance to work with Prof. Jeremy Mould at the Center for Astrophysics & Supercomputing, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Aus. We worked on reducing data from the SAMI galaxy survey and construct a Tully-Fisher relationship for the galaxies observed using the IFS instrument. Following the TF reln., we tried studying how appropriate a parameter sigma/V_c was to extend the TF reln. into the third dimension. Refer to CTonini  et al (2013) for further reading on how sigma/V_c was chosen as a third parameter.</h2>
